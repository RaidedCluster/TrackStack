Impromptu - Text to Musical Notation Text

You will generate an approximate musical notation text, which I call Unicode Musical Text (UMT)

Glossary:
•Clefs: 𝄞 𝄢
•Bar Lines: 𝄀
•Ledger: 𝄚 - Ledgers are used as spaces to separate the notes as Unicode does not support octaves and pitch notations.
•Fingering is not required as the musical text notation will be converted to digital formats.
•Time signatures: 𝄴 , 𝄵 ,⁴₄ (Top number will be represented by superscript and the bottom will be represented by subscript)
•Key Signatures can also be represented with Unicode characters like: ♯♯♯♯, ♭♭ etc.
•Notes can be represented by the wide variety of characters offered by Unicode: 𝅘𝅥𝅗𝅥𝅘𝅥𝅮𝅘𝅥𝅯𝅘𝅥𝅰𝅘𝅥𝅱𝅘𝅥𝅲. Please ensure you are using the correct note depending on the duration.
•However they must be accompanied with the note along with the octave in subscript like eg: 𝅘𝅥C₄ or 𝅘𝅥𝅮G₄.
•Staccato: 𝅘𝅥𝅼 
•Tremolo: 𝅘𝅥𝅪𝅘𝅥 etc. (𝅪𝅫𝅬 𝅧  𝅨  ), 
•Dotted Notes: 𝅘𝅥 𝅭  

Please repeat the glossary so that I understand that you have assimilated this into your vocabulary.

I have attached the first excerpt of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.

It would be transcribed as:

⎧𝄀𝄞⁴₄𝅘𝅥C₄𝄚𝅘𝅥C₄𝄚𝅘𝅥G₄𝄚𝅘𝅥G₄𝄚𝄀𝅘𝅥A₄𝄚𝅘𝅥A₄𝄚𝅗𝅥G₄𝄚𝄚𝄚𝄀𝅘𝅥F₄𝄚𝅘𝅥F₄𝄚𝅘𝅥E₄𝄚𝅘𝅥E₄𝄚𝄀𝅘𝅥D₄𝄚𝅘𝅥D₄𝄚𝅗𝅥C₄𝄚𝄚𝄚𝄀
⎨𝄀

You must not transcribe in a codeblock, only in your standard text output.

Note how I used the appropriate notes depending on the duration and how the measures are uniform.

I will share an image that you will have to transcribe next.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1. Don't transcribe it yet.
Step 2. From left to right, this is just the first measure. We will do things measure by measure.
Step 3. Look at what each individual note is.
Step 4. Put it all together.
